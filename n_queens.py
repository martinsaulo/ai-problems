Problem: N-Queens

Goal:
Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

Rules:
- A queen can attack any piece in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Constraints:
- No two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.
- Exactly one queen must be placed in each row.
- The final arrangement must have all N queens placed with no conflicts.

Input:
An integer N representing the size of the board and the number of queens.

Objective:
Find one possible configurations where N queens can be safely placed on the board
according to the rules.
